13. Take a few minutes to explore other aspects of the migration assessment.

>**Note**: The process of gathering information of operating system environments (OSE) and migrating data of VMs between environments takes some time due to the nature of transferring data.  However, there are a few steps that can be done to speed up and view how the system works.  These are a few options:
>
> Common steps to refresh data: (also see [Troubleshoot Discovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/troubleshoot-discovery#common-software-inventory-errors))
> 
> -	[Server data not updating in portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/troubleshoot-discovery#server-data-not-updating-in-portal) – if the servers’ data is not refreshing, this is a method to accelerate it.
> 
> -	[Do not see software inventory details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/troubleshoot-discovery#do-not-see-software-inventory-details-even-after-updating-guest-credentials) – by default the software inventory is only refreshed once every 24 hours. This forces a refresh.
> 
> -	[Software inventory errors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/troubleshoot-discovery#common-software-inventory-errors) – during inventory there are sometimes error codes returned. This lists all the error codes and meanings.
>
>_Refresh Data_
> 
> Many issues in the Migrate can be related to the appliance not refreshing the data due to regular schedules or data not being transferred.  Forcing the data and information to be updated can be achieved with the following steps:
> 1.	In Servers, databases and web apps > Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment, select Overview.
> 2.	Under Manage, select Appliances.
> 3.	Select Refresh services.
> 4.	Wait for the refresh operation to complete. You should now see up-to-date information.

#### Task summary 

In this task you created and configured an Azure Migrate migration assessment.

### Task 5: Configure dependency visualization

When migrating a workload to Azure, it is important to understand all workload dependencies. A broken dependency could mean that the application doesn't run properly in Azure, perhaps in hard-to-detect ways. Some dependencies, such as those between application tiers, are obvious. Other dependencies, such as DNS lookups, Kerberos ticket validation or certificate revocation checks, are not.

In this task, you will configure the Azure Migrate dependency visualization feature. This requires you to first create a Log Analytics workspace, and then to deploy agents on the to-be-migrated VMs.

1. Return to the **Azure Migrate** blade in the Azure Portal, select **Servers, databases and web apps (1)**. Under **Discovery and assessment** select **Groups (2)**,

    ![](images/Exercise1/azuremigrate-10.png)   

2. Select the **SmartHotel VMs** group to see the group details. 

   ![](images/Exercise1/select-group.png)   

3. Note that each VM has their **Dependencies** status as **Requires agent installation**. Select **Requires agent installation** for the **smarthotelweb1** VM.

   > **Note:** You do not need to configure the workspace ID and key when installing the Dependency Agent, since it uses the same settings as the Microsoft Monitoring Agent, which must be installed beforehand.

23. Close the virtual machine connection window for the **smarthotelweb1** VM.  Connect to the **smarthotelweb2** VM and repeat the installation process (steps 10-22) for both agents (the administrator password is the same as for smarthotelweb1). Close the virtual machine connection window for the **smarthotelweb2** VM, once the installation of agents is done.

You will now deploy the Linux versions of the Microsoft Monitoring Agent and Dependency Agent on the **UbuntuWAF** VM. To do so, you will first connect to the UbuntuWAF remotely using an SSH session.

24. Open a command prompt using the desktop shortcut.  

    > **Note**: The SmartHotelHost runs Windows Server 2019 with the Windows Subsystem for Linux enabled. This allows the command prompt to be used as an SSH client. More info of supported Linux on Azure can be found here: https://Azure.com/Linux. 

25. Enter the following command to connect to the **UbuntuWAF** VM running in Hyper-V on the SmartHotelHost:

    ```bash
    ssh demouser@192.168.0.8
    ```

26. Enter 'yes' when prompted whether to connect. Use the password **<inject key="SmartHotelHost Admin Password" />**.

    ![Screenshot showing the command prompt with an SSH session to UbuntuWAF.](images/Exercise1/ssh.png "SSH session with UbuntuWAF")

27. Enter the following command, followed by the password **<inject key="SmartHotelHost Admin Password" />** when prompted:
  
    ```
    sudo -s
    ```

    > This gives the terminal session elevated privileges.

28. Enter the following command, substituting \<Workspace ID\> and \<Workspace Key\> with the values copied previously. Answer **Yes** when prompted to restart services during package upgrades without asking.  

    ```
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/OMS-Agent-for-Linux/master/installer/scripts/onboard_agent.sh && sh onboard_agent.sh -w <Workspace ID> -s <Workspace Key>
    ```

    > **Note**: If you receive any error while running the above command, run the below command to update the packages and perform **Step 28** again.
     
     ```
     apt-get update
     ```

29. Enter the following command, substituting \<Workspace ID\> with the value copied earlier:

    ```s
    /opt/microsoft/omsagent/bin/service_control restart <Workspace ID>
    ```

30. Enter the following command. This downloads a script that will install the Dependency Agent.

    ```s
    wget --content-disposition https://aka.ms/dependencyagentlinux -O InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin
    ```

31. Install the dependency agent by running the script download in the previous step.

    ```s
    sh InstallDependencyAgent-Linux64.bin -s
    ```

#### Task summary 

In this task you configured the Azure Migrate dependency visualization feature, by creating a Log Analytics workspace and deploying the Azure Monitoring Agent and Dependency Agent on both Windows and Linux on-premises machines.

### Task 6: Explore dependency visualization

In this task, you will explore the dependency visualization feature of Azure Migrate. This feature uses data gathered by the dependency agent you installed in Task 5.

1. Return to the Azure Portal and refresh the Azure Migrate **SmartHotel VMs** VM group blade. The 3 VMs on which the dependency agent was installed should now show their status as **Installed**. (If not, refresh the page **using the browser refresh button**, not the refresh button in the blade.  It may take up to **5 minutes** after installation for the status to be updated.)

   ![Screenshot showing the dependency agent installed on each VM in the Azure Migrate VM group.](images/Exercise1/dependency-viz-installed.png "Dependency agent installed")
   
   >**Note**: If you notice that the dependency agent status is showing as **Requires Agent Installation** instead of Installed even after installing dependency agents in all the three VMs, please follow the steps from [here](https://github.com/CloudLabsAI-Azure/Know-Before-You-Go/blob/main/AIW-KBYG/AIW-Infrastructure-Migration.md#4-exercise1---task6---step1) to confirm dependency agent installation in VMs using Log Analytics workspace.
 
1. Select **View dependencies**.

   ![Screenshot showing the view dependencies button in the Azure Migrate VM group blade.](images/Exercise1/view-dependencies.png "View dependencies")
   
1. Take a few minutes to explore the dependencies view. Expand each server to show the processes running on that server. Select a process to see process information. See which connections each server makes.
