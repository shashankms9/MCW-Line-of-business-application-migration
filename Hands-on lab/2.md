## Exercise 2: Migrate the Application Database

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise you will migrate the application database from the on-premises Hyper-V virtual machine to a new database hosted in the Azure SQL Database service. You will use the Azure Database Migration Service to complete the migration, which uses the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant for the database assessment and schema migration phases.

### Task 1: Create the Database Migration Service

In this task you will create an Azure Database Migration Service resource. This resource is managed by the Microsoft.DataMigration resource provider.

> **Note**: The Azure Database Migrate Service (DMS) requires network access to your on-premises database to retrieve the data to transfer. To achieve this access, the DMS is deployed into an Azure VNet. You are then responsible for connecting that VNet securely to your database, for example by using a Site-to-Site VPN or ExpressRoute connection.
>
> In this lab, the 'on-premises' environment is simulated by a Hyper-V host running in an Azure VM. This VM is deployed to the 'smarthotelvnet' VNet. The DMS will be deployed to a separate VNet called 'DMSVnet'. To simulate the on-premises connection, these two VNet have been peered.

1. In the Azure portal, expand the portal's left navigation and select **+ Create a resource**, search for **Azure Database Migration Service** and select it.

2. On the **Azure Database Migration Service** blade, select **Create**.

3. In the **Create Migration Service** blade, on the **Basics** tab, enter the following values:
   
   - Subscription: **Select your Azure subscription**.
  
   - Resource group: **AzureMigrateRG**
  
   - Service Name: **SmartHotelDBMigration**
  
   - Location: **Choose the same region as the Resource Group**.

   - Service mode: **Azure**
  
   - Pricing tier: **Standard: 1 vCore**

5. Select **Review + create**, followed by **Create**.

> **Note**: Creating a new migration service can take around 20 minutes. You can continue to the next task without waiting for the operation to complete. You will not use the Database Migration Service until task 4.

#### Task summary 

In this task you created a new Azure Database Migration Service resource.

### Task 2: Assess the on-premises database using Data Migration Assistant

In this task you will use Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to assess the on-premises database. DMA is integrated with Azure Migrate providing a single hub for assessment and migration tools.

1. Return to the **Azure Migrate** blade in the Azure portal. Select the **Get Started** panel, then select **Assess and migrate databases**.

#### Task summary 

In this task you used Data Migration Assistant to assess an on-premises database for readiness to migrate to Azure SQL, and uploaded the assessment results to your Azure Migrate project. The DMA is integrated with Azure Migrate providing a single hub for assessment and migration tools.

### Task 3: Create a DMS migration project

In this task you will create a Migration Project within the Azure Database Migration Service (DMS). This project contains the connection details for both the source and target databases. In order to connect to the target database, you will also create a private endpoint allowing connectivity from the subnet used by the DMS.

In subsequent tasks, you will use this project to migrate both the database schema and the data itself from the on-premises SQL Server database to the Azure SQL Database.

We'll start by creating the private endpoint that allows the DMS to access the database server.

1. In the Azure portal, expand the portal's left navigation by selecting **Show portal menu** in the top left, then click on **Resource groups** and select the **SmartHotelRG** resource group, select the database server **smarthoteldb<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**.
 
   ![Azure portal screenshot showing the select path to create a SQL Database.](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-Line-of-business-application-migration/blob/fix/Hands-on%20lab/images/local/db1.png?raw=true "New SQL Database")
   
   ![Azure portal screenshot showing the select path to create a SQL Database.](images/Exercise2/dbrg-1.png "New SQL Database")

   ![Azure portal screenshot showing the select path to create a SQL Database.](images/Exercise2/dbrg-2.png "New SQL Database")

2. From the left hand side menu, select **Private endpoint connections** under **Security**, then **+ Private endpoint**.

   ![Azure portal screenshot showing the select path to create a SQL Database.](images/Exercise3/db2.1.png "New SQL Database")

3. On the **Basics** tab that appears, enter the following configuration then select **Next: Resource**. 

   - Resource group: **SmartHotelRG**
  
   - Name: **SmartHotel-DB-for-DMS**
  
   - Region: **Select the same region as the Resource Group**.
  
   ![Screenshot showing the 'Create a private endpoint' blade, 'Basics' tab.](images/Exercise2/dbrg-3.png "Private Endpoint - Basics")

4. On the **Resource** tab, entering the following configuration then select **Next: Configuration**. 

   - Connection method: **Connect to an Azure resource in my directory**.
  
   - Subscription: **Select your subscription**.
  
   - Resource type: **Microsoft.Sql/servers**
  
   - Resource: Select SQL database server **smarthoteldb<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** from the dropdown which you created previously.
   
   - Target sub-resource: **sqlServer**

   ![Screenshot showing the 'Create a private endpoint' blade, 'Resource' tab.](images/Exercise2/private-endpoint-2.png "Private Endpoint - Resource")
   
5. On the **Configuration** tab enter the following configuration, click on **Next: Tags** then select **Review + create**.

   - Virtual network: **DMSvnet**
  
   - Subnet: **DMS (10.1.0.0/24)**
  
   - Integrate with private DNS zone: **Yes**
  
   - Private DNS zones: (default) **privatelink.database.windows.net**

   ![Screenshot showing the 'Create a private endpoint' blade, 'Configuration' tab.](images/Exercise2/dbrg-4.png "Private Endpoint - Configuration")

6. Select **Create** and **Wait** for the deployment to complete. Once the deployment is done, click on  **Go to resource**.

   ![Screenshot showing the DNS entry for the SQL database server private endpoint](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-Line-of-business-application-migration/blob/fix/Hands-on%20lab/images/local/dbendpoint1.png?raw=true "Private Endpoint")

7. On the **SmartHotel-DB-for-DMS** private endpoint blade, from the left hand side menu select **DNS configuration** which is under **Settings**.

   ![Screenshot showing step 1 to find the DNS entry for the SQL database server private endpoint](images/Exercise2/private-endpoint-dns1.png "Find DNS for Private Endpoint")

8. On the **SmartHotel-DB-for-DMS | DNS configuration**, select the **Private DNS Zone** **privatelink.database.windows.net**.

   ![Screenshot showing step 2 to find the DNS entry for the SQL database server private endpoint](images/Exercise2/private-endpoint-dns2.png "Private DNS integration")

9. On the **privatelink.database.windows.net** overview blade, note that the **Record set** with name **smarthoteldb<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** and an internal IP address **10.1.0.5** is listed.

   ![Screenshot showing step 3 to find the DNS entry for the SQL database server private endpoint](images/Exercise2/private-endpoint-dns3.png "Private Endpoint IP address")

   >**Note**: Private DNS is used so that the database domain name, **\<your server\>.database.windows.net** resolves to the internal private endpoint IP address **10.1.0.5** when resolved from the DMSvnet, but resolves to the Internet-facing IP address of the database server when resolved from outside the DMSvnet. This means the same connection string (which contains the domain name) can be used in both cases.

10. Return to the Database server blade. Under **Security**, select **Firewalls and virtual networks**. Set 'Deny public network access' to **Yes**, then **Save** your changes.

    ![Screenshot showing the link to add an existing virtual network to the SQL database network security settings.](images/Exercise2/db-network.png "Database Server - Firewalls and virtual networks")
  
    In the Azure portal, navigate to the **SmartHotelRG** resource group, and then to the database server **smarthoteldb<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**.   From the Oveview page, copy the server name of the database and keep this in a text editor as we will be using this further.

11. Check that the Database Migration Service resource you created in task 3 has completed provisioning. You can check the deployment status from the **Deployments** pane in the **AzureMigrateRG** resource group blade.

    ![Screenshot showing the AzureMigrateRG - Deployments blade in the Azure portal. The Microsoft.AzureDMS deployment shows status 'Successful'.](images/Exercise2/dms-deploy.png "DMS deployment complete")

12. Navigate to the Database Migration Service **SmartHotelDBMigration** resource blade in the **AzureMigrateRG** resource group and select **+ New Migration Project**.

    ![Screenshot showing the Database Migration Service blade in the Azure portal, with the 'New Migration Project' button highlighted.](images/Exercise2/new-dms-project.png "New DMS migration project")
 
13. In the **New migration project** blade, enter the below information,

    - Project name : Enter **DBMigrate** 
    - Leave the source server type as SQL Server and target server type as Azure SQL Database.
    - Choose type of activity : Select Create project only from the dropdown
    - Select **Create**.
 
    ![Screenshot showing the Database Migration Service blade in the Azure portal, with the 'New Migration Project' button highlighted.](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-Line-of-business-application-migration/blob/fix/Hands-on%20lab/images/local/Migration-1.png?raw=true "DMS migration project - settings")

14. The Migration Wizard opens, showing the **Select source** step. Complete the settings as follows, then select **Next: Select databases**.

    - Source SQL Server instance name: **10.0.0.4**
  
    - Authentication type: **SQL Authentication**
  
    - User Name: **sa**
  
    - Password: **<inject key="SmartHotelHost Admin Password" />**

    - Encryption connection: **Checked**
  
    - Trust server certificate: **Checked**

    ![Screenshot showing the 'Select source' step of the DMS Migration Wizard.](images/Exercise2/select-source.png "DMS project - Select source")

    > **Note**: The DMS service connects to the Hyper-V host, which has been pre-configured with a NAT rule to forward incoming SQL requests (TCP port 1433) to the SQL Server VM. In a real-world migration, the SQL Server VM would most likely have its own IP address on the internal network, via an external Hyper-V switch.
    > The Hyper-V host is accessed via its private IP address (10.0.0.4). The DMS service accesses this IP address over the peering connection between the DMS VNet and the SmartHotelHost VNet. This simulates a VPN or ExpressRoute connection between a DMS VNet and an on-premises network.

15. In the **Select databases** step, the **Smarthotel.Registration** database should already be selected. Select **Next: Select target**.

    ![Screenshot showing the 'Select databases' step of the DMS Migration Wizard.](images/Exercise2/select-databases.png "DMS project - Select databases")

16. Complete the **Select target** step as follows, then select **Next: Summary**:

    - Target server name: **smarhoteldb<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>.database.windows.net**
  
    - Authentication type: **SQL Authentication**
  
    - User Name: <inject key="SmartHotelHost Admin Username"></inject>
  
    - Password: **<inject key="SmartHotelHost Admin Password" />**

    - Encrypt connection: **Checked**

    ![Screenshot showing the DMS migration target settings.](images/Exercise2/select-target.png "DMS project - select target")

    > **Note**: You can find the target server name in the Azure portal by browsing to your database.

    ![Screenshot showing the Azure SQL Database server name.](images/Exercise2/sql-db-name.png "SQL database server name")

17. At the **Project summary** step, review the settings and select **Save project** to create the migration project.

    ![Screenshot showing the DMS project summary.](images/Exercise2/project-summary.png "DMS project - summary")

#### Task summary 

In this task you created a Migration Project within the Azure Database Migration Service. This project contains the connection details for both the source and target databases. A private endpoint was used to avoid exposing the database on a public IP address.

### Task 4: Migrate the database schema

In this task you will use the Azure Database Migration Service to migrate the database schema to Azure SQL Database. This step is a prerequisite to migrating the data itself.

The schema migration will be carried out using a schema migration activity within the migration project created in task 5.

1. The Azure portal should show a blade for the DBMigrate DMS project. Select **+ New Activity** and select **Schema only migration** from the drop-down.

   ![Screenshot showing the 'New Activity' button within an Azure Database Migration Service project, with 'Schema only migration' selected from the drop-down.](https://github.com/CloudLabs-MCW/MCW-Line-of-business-application-migration/blob/fix/Hands-on%20lab/images/local/Migration2.png?raw=true "New Activity")
